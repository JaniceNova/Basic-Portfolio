   Hello World!  At a young age, I realized I was very passionate about learning.  This led me to the obvious conclusion of majoring in education at Slippery Rock University but it also led to so unexpected occurrences.  One of said occurrences was I tried out a lot of different part-time jobs.  My two favorite part-time jobs were being a stylist at David's Bridal and exploring the Temple of the Forbidden Eye as a attractions cast-member at Disney.  Whether it was saying yes to the dress or training eager archaeologists, I loved that these jobs allowed me to create magic.  <br><br>My first full time job was teaching.  While I loved working with my students, I decided I didn't want to be done with my experience being a full-time student.  So I decided to attend a code camp so I could focus on learning web design.
